This is a video mapper running on Raspberry Pi, and controlled over network from a distant computer.
An almost unlimited number of Raspberry Pis can be controlled at the same time, and everything can be scripted.

Each Pi is attached to a projector with a small hdmi cable, and wired to the network, or connected to a WiFi router.
The medias are hosted on the Pi and can be transfered via network.

* Each be controlled, automated and scripted:
  * Purr-data patch to make all kind of **cue scripting** with very powerful features

* Videos are loaded directly on sd-cards:
  * No video cables required all over the place, only Ethernet cables (or WiFi).
  * autonomous playing (5w consumption) for installations purposes

* changing source is easy as hell
